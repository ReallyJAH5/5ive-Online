I’m going to a place where time and space doesn’t matter dreams capture the mind’s capability to see past here and now lyric droughts only happen if yu aren’t living enough life focused on who the fuck likes yu I to am affected by cyclep of life and the system inside it this sick ass society deep behind all the layers of life yu lived yo inner kid so I’m going wherever he wanna go he wanna know what’s going on so imma put him down since I found him I been happier ain’t quite mapped it out yet but I think he said he proud of me and ian made it far yet but farther than I thought we’d be and we ain’t seen shit yet success is only measurable as the scale yu put it on</p>

            <p class="poem-p">Baby can I be your backbone kuz yu make me feel child like even tho I’m grown I may not have known yu for a while but on my soul every hour we spend feels like an eternity and I mean that in the best way baby yu refresh me like a like a cool mint when yu step out the shower I’d devour every inch of you disregarding my principles or what I stand for baby can yu stand more say yes or yu demand war kuz the bed is our dance floor and my mind a prison or playground depending on if yu listen to what I say and how besides that climax is my resting state I couldn’t hesitate to be with yu if they hazed me boo kuz being in your presence is like seeing 6 seconds of vine for the first time she speaks with validity and resides divinely in femininity so much so that my energys overtaken but I’m grateful and elated we faded and in my space again I just wish the days we spent lasted forever another signed 5 letter</p>
